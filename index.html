        <h2>Freshman in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I am a freshman at Bob Jones University studying Ministry and Leadership. When I'm not in the classroom or doing homework, you will probably find me involved in a university society, hanging out with friends, working with kids, or sleeping :P</p>
         <p>
            I enjoy spending quality time with family and friends, and I love teaching and interacting with kids at summer camp, in my local church, and around my neighborhood.
         </p> 
         <p>
            I am a little girl with big dreams and a bigger God, and I am on a mission.
